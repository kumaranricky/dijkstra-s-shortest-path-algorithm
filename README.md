# Dijkstra's Shortest Path Algorithm
## AIM

To develop a code to find the shortest route from the source to the destination point using Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm.

## THEORY
To implement Best-First_Search ( BFS ) algorithm to find the route between an initial state to a final state.
Something like google maps. We create a dictionary to act as the dataset for the search alogrithm, containing all the distances between all the nodes ( Places ).

## DESIGN STEPS

### STEP 1:
Identify a location in the google map:

### STEP 2:
Select a specific number of nodes with distance


### STEP 3: 
Create a dictionary with all the node pairs (keys) and their respective distances as the values

### STEP 4: 
Implement the search algorithm by passing any node and f(node) to find a Best route.

### STEP 5: 
Display the route sequence.


## ROUTE MAP
#### Include your own map
#### Example map

## OUTPUT:

Justify that the algorithm always returns the shortest path:
